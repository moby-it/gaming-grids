# UI Notes

This is a document that describes issues with current UI, as of 5/3/2024. The overall UI needs refinement. I'll note down some things that might not be obvious

1. Grid is not responsive
2. `GUESSES LEFT` element is positioned relatively and creates issues on different screens.
3. Elements are too spaced out.
4. Search on champion misses highlight on arrow scroll, select-on-enter and close on escape.

A good website guideline is https://pokegrid.net/. It has a slick and simple design.
