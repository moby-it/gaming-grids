# UI Notes

This is a document that describes issues with current UI, as of 5/3/2024. The overall UI needs refinement. I'll note down some things that might not be obvious

1. Grid is not responsive.
2. Check that `GUESSES LEFT` element is positioned appropriately on all screens.

A good website guideline is https://pokegrid.net/. It has a slick and simple design.
